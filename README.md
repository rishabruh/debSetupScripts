# debSetupScripts
Debian-based system setup scripts for systems such as Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop_OS, etc. These scripts can be easily customised for installing preferred packages. 
# How to use
Caution: Never execute random scripts from the internet unless you trust the source. Be sure to check the scripts for yourself in a text editor before executing. 
>> Download the code to a zip file and extract it into a folder. 
>> Right click in your file manager and open that directory in the terminal.
>> Now give execution permissions to these scripts. Use ```$ chmod +x [script name]```
>> Now execute the script with ```$./[script name]``` (If the terminal gives a permission-related error, add "sudo" before the command.)
>> Enter your sudo password when required.
>> Done!
